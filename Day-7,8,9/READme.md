# Collaborative Filtering

This notebook contains implimentation of famous recommender system called as Collaborative Filtering. It is used widely by lot of companies like Netflix and Amazon for reccomondation.

I have used Pytorch and Fastai library to implement this. They are super easy to use and really helpful in implimentation from scratch.

Here are some more resources to learn more on Collaborative Filtering and reccomondation systems.
